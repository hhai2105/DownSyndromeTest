* Down Syndrome Testing
A Down Syndrome testing software.

* Steps In the prcess
** TODO Create Image cropping technique
Created a GUI that let user choose 4 points of an image
Warp image into a specific size using opencv
** DONE Component extraction based on RGB color model
Based on the paper, we've created a binary image from the equation
BI = R1 > 1.06 \times G1 & R1 > 1.09 \times B1
The Following pictures were created.
[[./img/original/100.png]] [[./img/BinaryImage/img.png]]
** DONE Gray Projection value processing based on test strip
The following method has been implemented using old Method of Image processing
The Following graph was created.

* Old Method of Image processing(Documented)
- Turn image into “grayscale”, black and white photo
Saturation value does not change horizontally as seen in photo above, so we turn the photo into a two dimensional set of data, with the x axis being the pixel number going from top to bottom, and the y axis being the saturation (lightness) of the pixel
[[./img/10.png][Fig 3]]
- to find the test and control lines, we made a graph of change in pixel saturation. We also find the most common saturation value, and say that this is the white of the test strip. Whenever the change in saturation went past a threshold relative to this average, we would say that there is a T or C line.fig3
- split up the left and right side, consider each separately
- we then found the max value of the t and c lines
- next we made a plot of max t sat values vs the known hCG concentration for each test photo:
- as seen above, there is a linear relationship between the log of hcg concentration and the max t sat value. This was stated in the article, however we proved that our algorithm provides the same results
